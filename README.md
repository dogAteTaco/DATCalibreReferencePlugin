Finally, either manually copy the text of the box or click on the _Copy to Clipboard_ button to use it on your document<br><br>

**Note:** if you are missing any of the fields neccessary for the reference a message will appear with a warning. Simply add the missing fields and create your references again. If you are unsure how to add the ISBN code of your book modify the metadata of your book and in the _Ids_ fields add something like this _isbn:12345678_. Calibre will verify that the code is valid.
